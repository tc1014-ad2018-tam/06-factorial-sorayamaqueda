/*
 * This program is to calculate the factorial of any given number by the user. Usually the factorial is calculated by
 * multiplying the selected number by all the numbers that came before it up to 1 (The zero is obviously excluded).
 * In this program we used the symbol *= which multiplies and then assigns the value after the equal sign.
 * We also used the unsigned variable because we want to work only with positive integers.
 *
 * Problem Analysis.
 * Problem: Write a program which allows us to calculate the factorial of any given number. The factorial of n number
 * is the product of multiplying such number by all the numbers which came before it.
 * Input: The number of which the user wants to find the factorial.
 * Calculations: n * (n-1) * (n-2) ... while n!=0
 * Outputs: Factorial of n
 *
 * Algorithm.
 * 1 Begin
 * 2 Ask the user for the number they want the factorial of
 * 3 Verify that the number is a positive integer
 * 4 Specify that if n=0 then factorial=1
 * 5 Specify that if n=1 then factorial=1
 * 6 If n!= 0 or 1, then multiply n by al the numbers before it
 * 7 Display the factorial
 * 8 End
